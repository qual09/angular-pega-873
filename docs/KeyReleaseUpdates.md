## Key Updates Since release SP-A.87.2
* Auth class updates within auth.ts (including designating many class methods as private)
* Code, build script and README updates to facilitate simplified deployment to any web server directory
* Hide grid's Add and Delete Row buttons when `layout.displayGridFooter` is _`false`_ (only available when **v1DXAPIFUA DSS** setting is enabled)

## Key Updates Since release SP-A.87.1
* Examine server related field value changes as part of a refresh and generate corresponding Page Instructions if appropriate
* Authentication related fixes/improvements:
    * Fixed browser reload leveraging prior basic authentication credentials after a logout operation
    * Fixed browser reload occasionally logging out the user
    * Moved auth related info from local to session storage (which gets cleared on logout or when browser tab is closed)
    * Replaced "oidc-client" library with PegaAuth library implementation('Auth' class in auth.ts file within _helpers)
    * Properly leverage refresh tokens (configurable in Infinity 8.7 for OAuth 2.0 Public client registrations or for Confidential clients in earlier releases when a client_secret is also specified in endpoints.ts) to silently obtain new access_tokens and seamlessly retry transactions that may have failed with a HTTP 401 error due to expired access token
    * Utilize popup window when available refresh token expires for proper "full reauthentication"
    * Revoke active access and refresh tokens on logout when use_revoke endpoints.ts setting is enabled
* Fixed issues when creating new cases via the "New harness"
* Fixed "click" event (within an action set) not working for radiobutton fields
* Added appAlias property within endpoints.ts to enable operators accessing secondary apps configured within their operator record.
* Expose section name used for case details within settings to offer greater flexibility (might be useful for Theme-Cosmos...as pyCaseDetails does not exist for that theme).
* Fixed error on submit and save operations when privileges pxPerformAssignmentDX and pxUpdateCaseDX are in use.  This is related to posting field values for fields which are no longer displayed because of a specified visibility when.
* Fixed visibility check for caption.
* Upgrade to Angular 13

## Key Updates Since release 1.42
* Upgrade to Angular 12
* Support for Screen flow for any screens which are part of a Multi-Step Form Process (Pega Infinity 8.5+)
* Added "dirty flag" setting and checking this to avoid save on back and also to disable Save action until some modification was actually done.
* "endpoints.ts" file is made simpler now to just have one URL, other endpoints settings can be autogenerated if not specified.
* Login UI is made simpler, users no longer needs to enter client_id in the UI for OAuth 2.0 login type.
* Extensive README.md file updates
* Leverage newer Date Range properties available for pxDateTime (Pega Infinity 8.7+)

* Updates for Page Instructions for pages within a page list
* Updates to Dropdown control and treatment of placeholder
